# NeonWave
A little Java app that lets you play with neon lines in 3D space on a black canvas.
Watch them morph and bend around your screen, gravitating toward the center.

Click and drag to create waves.

# 3D Mode
Press "R" to enable 3D mode. It looks very cool, but is fairly resource intensive considering the thousands of lines.
If you have a potato for a computer, I wouldn't advise doing this as it may lag and crash.

Requires JavaFX, Java's platform for making desktop apps.
